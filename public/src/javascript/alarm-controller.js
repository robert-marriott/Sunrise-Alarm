//This will start with on document ready. button handlers and everything will be inside that so it can be
//used on the page. other methods for number crunching and whatnot will be declared outside of it.

$( document ).ready(function() {
    console.log( "document is ready!" );
});


//var formData = JSON.stringify($("#myForm").serializeArray());
